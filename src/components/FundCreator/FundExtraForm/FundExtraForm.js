        Currently nothing's here. We will leave this one blank for now. Well
        maybe we can add a little something. Here are some fun alpaca facts:
        There are only two different breeds of alpacas. Alpacas are related to
        more than llamas. They belong to the Camelidae family, which also
        includes Camels. Most alpacas are 48-54 inches tall and can weigh
        anywhere from 106 to 185 pounds.Since they are a completely domesticated
        animal, alpacas can live for a pretty long time. If they are taken care
        of really well, they can live for up to 20 years or so. Another way you
        can tell an alpaca from a llama (other than their size, of course) is
        their ears. If you look closely, you will notice that alpacas have
        shorter, straighter ears than a llama. Just donâ€™t get too close! Both of
        these animals are known to spit if they get annoyed. Yuck!
